\section*{Abstract}
The Walkway Project is an ongoing exploration into modeling and execution of various assets, started in early 2022 by Ethan Havemann and Jiale Chen. Development comprises a complete trading pipeline and research platform. Walkway would not be possible without the continued support of Professors Ilya Mikhelson and Zhaoran Wang. For more information, see open source modules on GitHub.
